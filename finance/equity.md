## Trading Adages

Here are some concepts I have learned and developed over
the years.  The order of this list is important.

#### Take a long term strategy with the stock market
Buy the best companies and hold them forever.  Sometimes
its challenging to admit to yourself that the best company
is no longer the best company.  But the other adages below
will help guide you on making that assessment.

#### The trend is your friend
This means that by determining the trend of a stock will tell
you the direction its moving.  If the trend is down then the
stock is moving down over a longer time period.  The opposite
is true on the up side.  You can usually spot longer term trends
by looking at 5 year stock charts and just seeing the direction its
moving.  The third option is flat which is also common.  A good technical
trading indicator is the 50 and 200 day moving average.

#### Buy top quality companies
There are lots of lists out there with the best companies.
But for me the best companies are ones you see around you everyday.
In 2020 examples would be:
* Apple
* Costco
* Microsoft
* Starbucks
* Amazon
* Netflix
* Berkshire Hathaway
* McDonalds
* Walmart
* Intuit

#### Buy low sell high
Although a trivial concept getting this right is not as easy.

#### High Paying Dividends are Risky
If a stock is sporting a high dividend the market is saying this stock
is risky.  Just because you are getting lots of yield does not mean
that the overall return will be that great if the stock gets hammered.

#### The Scariest trade is sometimes the best trade
Meaing that when people are scared or in fear about the market or
a particular equity that sometimes creates the best opportunity.
